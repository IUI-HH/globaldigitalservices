                Much of the current conversation about the use of generative AI in filmmaking was spurred by the 2023
                WGA (<a href="https://www.wga.org/" target="_blank">Writer's Guild of America</a>) strike. The two main
                issues in this labor dispute with the AMPTP
                (<a href="https://www.amptp.org/" target="_blank">Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
                    Producers</a>)--residuals from streaming media and the role of
                generative AI tools like ChatGPT in scriptwriting—both highlighted ways that new technologies are
                impacting writers in the film industry.

                    <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>Currently AI tools like <a href="https://www.scriptbook.io/" target="_blank">Scriptbook</a> can
                        be used to create full scripts in specific genres or on
                        specific topics within minutes, including dialogue, character arcs, and scene directions. Other
                        tools, like <a href="https://storyfit.com/" target="_blank">StoryFit</a>, can be used to
                        fine-tune scripts to produce movies that will appeal to
                        particular audiences. Writers can also use AI-generated text as sources of inspiration to
                        enhance their own creativity</p>

                    <h2>Concerns</h2>
                    <p>That said, there is concern that use of AI-generated writing will lead to job losses for
                        scriptwriters, accompanied by an increase in formulaic content in the film industry, since AI
                        cannot achieve the same level of creativity and emotional depth that human writers can. Beyond
                        this, there are ethical concerns with the way that AI text generators are trained (Where does
                        the data come from? What biases does it contain? Was permission granted to use the data to train
                        an AI system? Does it violate data privacy restrictions?) and whether AI-generated works can
                        themselves be copyrighted.</p>

                <p>Part of the motivation for the WGA strike was to “<a
                        href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/writers-guild-artificial-intelligence-proposal-1235560927/"

                        use</a> of material produced using artificial
                    intelligence or similar technologies.” Specifically, representatives of the writers wanted
                    assurances that AI would not be used for writing or rewriting literary material, that they would not
                    be asked to adapt or rewrite AI-generated source material, and that their own work would not be used
                    to train AI technologies. The writers and studios reached a tentative agreement on these issues in
                    late September 2023. </p>
                <p>According to <a

                        similar sentiments:</a>
                    “AI
                    can certainly assemble a recombinant screenplay by drawing on the collected works of people like
                    Scott
                    Frank, and the result may even be schematically sound—but getting an audience to really care about
                    what
                    happens to fictional characters requires a different sort of magic.”</p>
