<h2>Overview</h2>
<details>
<summary>International collaboration course background</summary>
<p>Students in the Indiana University (IU) course &ldquo;Information Structures for the Web&rdquo; and select Haaga-Helia (HH) students came together in the Spring 2024 semester to conduct an international collaboration. This year&rsquo;s collaboration continued to build upon the initial groundwork that had been laid between the two schools as part of the Global Classroom Initiative in the Spring 2021 Semester.</p>
<p>Students in William Helling&rsquo;s IU course partnered with students recruited by Kasper Valtakari at HH; we had enough students for five small groups working to develop their own respective websites.</p>
<p>HH students were added to the IUPUI Canvas course as students via their IU guest accounts where they see lectures and submit assignment just like the IU students. HH students were also added as guests to an instance of IU Microsoft Teams to work on designing their websites. All code for the websites was developed in GitHub.</p>
<p>In a further extension of this international collaboration, 15 IU students traveled to Helsinki and met with their classroom partners from Haaga-Helia. Over the course of two weeks in Finland, the IU students&rsquo; activities included field trips and site visits relevant to the international collaboration, such as Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, as well as to Finnish culture in general via visits to historic sites, museums, industries, and relevant events.</p>

<details>
<summary>How did we divide the students?</summary>
<p>Students in this class were asked to provide some indication of their skills so that the instructors could place them into groups with an appropriate mixture of talents for a website creation team.</p>
<p>IUI and HH students took a survey that sought thier knowledge/proficiency with:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML (markup/coding, etc.)</li>
<li>CSS (styles, template manipulation, etc.)</li>
<li>Graphic Design (can you edit images? can you create images? etc.)</li>
<li>Information Architecture (usability, accessibility, website design principles, etc.)</li>
<li>Presentation Skills (creating slides or presentations of some type)</li>
<li>Data Analytics skills (dealing with data, creating data visualizations, etc.</li>
<li>Other Artistic Skills (colors, design, etc.)</li>
<li>English Writing/Language Skills</li>
<li>Working in groups</li>
<li>Skills you think would be valuable for your group project</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What were the guidelines for the group project websites?</summary>
<p>Students were divided into groups depending on their talents and school affiliation. They were then allowed to communicate with each other to determine their own topic based on the general them of providing digital services. The technical guidelines were more strict:</p>
<ul>
<li>The website will have at least 5 pages (the total depends on your content, skills, etc., but you do not need too many to address a topic that is <em>focused</em>).</li>
<li>HTML will be valid as per W3C Markup Validation Service: <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">https://validator.w3.org/</a></li>
<li>CSS will be valid as per W3C CSS Validation Service: <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a></li>
<li>Pages will be accessible as per WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool: <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">https://wave.webaim.org/</a></li>
<li>Pages will be responsive for all devices.</li>
<li>Preferred layout strategy is with <strong><em>named-area grid layouts</em></strong> (as covered in Module 6) so that all group members can understand the code and perhaps contribute.</li>
<li>For those with scripting skills: Client-side scripting is permitted (e.g., JavaScript), but our final sites will be on GitHub. GitHub does not allow server-side scripting, so you can't use that (e.g., PHP, JAVA).</li>
<li>No use of frameworks allowed (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What were the main roles?</summary>
<p>Each group member tried to contribute talents and skills according to their abilities. The main assigned roles were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML/CSS tech:</strong> Will work on the markup for the website, get the tech stuff done with HTML/CSS and figure out other tech issues.</li>
<li><strong>graphic design:</strong> Will work on images needed for the site, finding, creating, and manipulating graphics (including video)</li>
<li><strong>IA/presentation/accessibility:</strong> Will work on site usability in all areas.</li>
<li><strong>data analytics/visualizations:</strong> Will supply data if needed (depending on the topic chosen) and also create visualizations, working with anyone else doing graphic design</li>
<li><strong>artistic skills:</strong> Will help control the look-and-feel of the site, its design and layout, including colors, fonts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>content writing (English):</strong> Will gather the content; edit it for grammar, syntax, and clarity; ensure proper citation of sources (if needed)</li>
</ul>

"As we come into the 2024 academic year, the conversation about AI in the classroom has continued to draw attention from educators, students, and lawmakers alike. AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is a type of technology used to act as or complete a task in place of a human. Due to this definition, educators have begun to question the usefulness of AI in the classroom."
