                The use of generative AI to modify or replace actors ranges from standard practices, like altering actor
                appearances and creating AI-generated voices for animated characters, to the highly controversial, like
                creating digital twins of actors in movies in which they did not act.

                    <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>In the 2023 film “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” <a href="https://metaphysic.ai/"
                            target="_blank">Metaphysic AI</a> was used to (somewhat
                        convincingly) de-age Harrison Ford in flashback scenes. This technology involves the creation of
                        a digital mesh of an actor's face from their past work that can be overlaid on top of the
                        actor's own live performance during post-production—or on the performance of a different actor,
                        as in the case of the Princess Leia cameo in “Rogue One” (2018), in which the youthful face of
                        Carrie Fisher was overlaid on the performance of Norwegian actress Ingvild Delia.</p>
                    <p>In the documentary “Welcome to Chechnya” (2020), similar so-called deepfake technology was used
                        to protect the anonymity of onscreen subjects, allowing them to talk about dangerous subjects
                        without fear of retribution. </p>
                    <p>Generative AI can also be used to synthesize voices and <a href="design.html">to create actors from scratch</a>. This
                        latter technology was used to create agents for crowd scenes in “The Lord of the Rings” (2001),
                        “Avatar” (2009), and “The Avengers” (2012) that could be programmed with sets of options that
                        might play out differently in different situations to make their movements look realistic. In
                        these cases, AI can reduce the need to hire extras who might be put in dangerous situations and
                        to put those characters in situations that would be impossible for human actors. Virtual actors
                        can also be modified in real-time without the need for refilming. AI technology from <a
                            href="http://www.worldwidexr.com/" target="_blank">Worldwide
                            XR</a> has even been used to revive dead actors, like James Dean and Tupac Shakur.</p>

                    <h2>Concerns</h2>
                    <p>Increases in the use of AI have led to concerns about job security and opportunities for working
                        actors. There are also ethical concerns about the data being used to train the AI software:
                        Where was it obtained and was permission granted for its use? What rights do actors have to
                        their own images?
                    </p>
                    <p> Without regulation of the use of actors faces, voices, and performances, the use of AI-generated
                        actors is open to misuse, like the creation of deepfake images and videos in which anyone's face
                        can be stitched onto a body double.</p>

                <h2>Response</h2>
                <p> The threat of deepfakes, in particular, keeps actors and crew members wary. Olcun Tan, a German
                    visual effects supervisor working in Hollywood, <a
                        href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film"
                        target="_blank">says:</a> “AI is in a sense cool and fun in the
                    beginning but then you realise it's actually dangerous. </p>
                <p>It can imitate people and make them do things on screen and then you can have a whole societal belief
                    that those people are disgraced for whatever they did on screen and in reality it wasn't even
                    them. It's just a ploy to wind people up.” When signing contracts, actors around the world are being
                    asked to consider the future use of their likenesses without understanding the potential
                    consequences: Indian stars Rashmika Mandanna, Alia Bhatt, and Anil Kapoor have given consent for
                    their likenesses to be used for other projects, whereas American star Keanu Reeves's contracts
                    include a clause that bans studios from digitally editing his performances. </p>
