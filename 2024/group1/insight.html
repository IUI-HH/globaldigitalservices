                        prompt. At first I felt a sense of impending doom about how our society defines 'art', and that
                        the touch of a human hand will lose value, making many creative jobs obsolete... including my
                        own.
                        Once I started playing around with it, I felt slightly more empowered, and I could see how I
                        might
                        incorporate it into my own work someday - mostly for reference sourcing in a similar way to

                        few parts of the filmmaking process that are repetitive types of assembly line work, but you
                        still need an artist behind the wheel. For example, motion capture has evolved the way
                        an animator works, but has not become a substitute for their work. Animators are taking motion
                        capture data and using it as a foundation to build and expand upon to reach their end goal more
                        quickly.”

                <p>This roadmap above shows how generative AI is currently affecting the film industry and how it can

                    sophisticated chatbots specifically catered to filmmaking.</p>

                <h2>Predictions</h2>
                <p>As AI technologies continue to evolve, filmmakers and studios will undoubtedly find new and
                    innovative ways to leverage AI to push the boundaries of storytelling and visual storytelling. Once
                    the novelty of AI wears off, however, it's not clear what its impact will be. </p>
                <p>It is undeniable that as the quality of AI-generated film increases, the industry will need to adapt,
                    and film schools will need to quickly incorporate AI tools into their curricula. Beyond the industry
                    itself, governing bodies in the United Kingdom and the European Union are currently formulating
                    plans to regulate AI use. European funding agencies are beginning to ask for transparency about AI
                    use from applicants but are holding off for now on being prescriptive. Likewise, the Alliance of
                    Motion Picture and Television Producers (<a href="https://www.amptp.org/" target="_blank">AMPTP</a>)
                    calls for “a balanced approach based on careful use,
                    not prohibition.”</p>
                <p>Ultimately, it is not likely that generative AI will fully replace humans in the film industry.
                    Instead, AI will be used to augment the work of humans—to make things faster and cheaper and make
                    movies that are more compelling—trends that are already visible in studios linked to Disney, Amazon,
                    and Netflix. <a

                        target="_blank">Kristy Kay</a>, Los-Angeles-based Visual Development Artist and Illustrator,
                    sums up the
                    (limited) promise of AI in filmmaking: “Despite my early fears of the human touch losing its
                    value... I think that art created by humans will become even more valuable, and precious. We all
                    want to see and hear real human stories, so that we feel seen and connected. The best art comes from
                    a place of honesty, and imperfection. I think the novelty of AI generated stories and pictures will
                    lose its shine.”</p>
