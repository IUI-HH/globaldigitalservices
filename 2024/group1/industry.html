                <p>The film industry is also finding a role for generative AI in offices and board rooms, where it can
                    be used to automate time-consuming tasks, predict ratings, and save production costs.

                    <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>During pre-production phases, AI can be used to provide inspiration for everything from visual
                        themes to filming locations. Tools like <a href="https://home.largo.ai/"
                            target="_blank">Largo.ai</a> can be used to analyze scripts, characters, and
                        actor appearances to make casting recommendations based on commercial potential. Both text and
                        film
                        tools can also be used to create pitch-decks and trailers.</p>
                    <p>Generative AI tools like <a href="https://www.cinelytic.com/" target="_blank">Cinelytic</a> can
                        be used to predict the success of films within different
                        demographics, information that can be used to guide acquisition and marketing decisions.
                        During filming, AI can be used to facilitate the creation of complex scheduling grids.
                        Productions
                        can also save money by using AI to create virtual environments that will eliminate the need for
                        expensive--and potentially dangerous--physical sets.</p>

                    <p>A January 2024 <a

                            target="_blank">report
                            from the consulting firm CVL Economics</a> (based on a survey of 300
                        entertainment
                        industry leaders) predicts that 62,000 industry jobs will be consolidated, replaced, or
                        eliminated
                        by AI within the next three years. These jobs will likely include staff positions as well as
                        crew
                        and actors. Entry-level positions will be most at risk, since employees in those positions are
                        typically tasked with doing the time-consuming grunt-work that AI can now automate.</p>
                    <p>In addition to ethical concerns about what data is used by AI scouting and casting models and
                        where
                        it comes from, use of these models might lead to a lack of diversity in hiring, including too
                        much
                        recycling of old actors.</p>

                        in
                        Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, laments the potential loss of the social aspects of a film
                        industry
                        run by AI: “What it means to follow a project as it's unfolding, not just to watch a finished
                        film
                        or stream a TV show, is important. Our knowledge of the creative labour and these human
                        dimensions
                        of it are part of the enjoyment that spectators derive from the films and part of what makes the
                        film and television industry distinct. It needs to do its business in public.”</p>

                <img src="images/industrygraph1.jpg" alt="Graph demonstrating the loss of film related jobs in the United States due to AI">
                <p>From above, it is approximated that by 2026, 203,800 jobs in the film industry in the U.S. will be
                    replaced by generative AI. The state of California will be most affected with a loss of 62,000 jobs.
                    New York also has a relatively high concentration of jobs, and over the next few years, 26,000 film
                    industry jobs will be cut there as well</p>
                <img src="images/industrygraph2.jpg" alt="Comparison of time and cost spent in conventional and virtual production">
                <p>The above graph shows how generative AI can reduce time spent on production and how much money it can
                    save. It is estimated that both the cost and time spent can be reduced by 5-10%.</p>
