Many educators view the use of AI written content as plagiarized.

                    <p>Due to AIâ€™s ability to write whole papers and projects, many students have shown a lack of writing and thinking skills. According to <a href="https://chass.ncsu.edu/news/2023/03/27/how-is-ai-changing-how-we-write-and-create/" target="_blank">NC State University</a>, the use of AI in the classroom can also cause a lack of individual thinking.</p>

                    <p>Although AI tends to be depicted in media as thinking for itself, the program itself is only as smart as the one who created it. <a href="https://www.waldenu.edu/programs/education/resource/five-pros-and-cons-of-ai-in-the-education-sector" target="_blank">Waldon University</a> explains that AI is not something to be feared, but rather something to be wary about due to the biases that a program may have. These biases will be based on what information the AI has been given.</p>

                    <p>Increased reliance on AI for learning tasks can lead to reduced human interaction and collaboration among students. As students begin to interact with AI for projects and essays, there becomes less of a need to go to outside sources or partners for any form of collaboration, as explained by <a href="https://www.waldenu.edu/programs/education/resource/five-pros-and-cons-of-ai-in-the-education-sector" target="_blank">Waldon University</a>.</p>
