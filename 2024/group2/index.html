            <h1>Welcome to Our AI in Education Initiative</h2>
<div class="info-box">
	
            <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> Welcome all educators, parents, students, and law makers who work with, or are affiliated with education! We wish to provide the best information about AI for your curiosity and educational benefits! As we come into the 2024 academic year, the conversation about AI in the classroom has continued to draw attention from educators, students, and lawmakers alike. AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is a type of technology used to act as or complete a task in place of a human. Due to this definition, educators have begun to question the usefulness of AI in the classroom. However, many would argue there is just as much benefit as there is concern for AI in education.  Our goal is to provide a source of AI information that will privy anyone interested in knowing both the benefits and concerns of AI in education.   </p>
</div>
<div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>What is our Purpose?</strong> Our goal is to educate others on the implementation of AI in classrooms. With education being our only goal, we wish to provide current and relevant understanding of what Ai is, how it impacts education, and some general arguments for and against its use. </p>
</div>
<div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Who Are We?</strong> We are a group of Graduate students at IU Indianapolisâ€™ School of Library and Informatic Sciences. Having spent the past semester exploring the benefits of a reliable and accessible website, we collaborated to create this platform to inform about AI in education.</p>
</div>
<div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Why Write About It?</strong> AI has begun to infiltrate a variety of organizations and businesses within the past few years. Due to its growing popularity, it is important to know how it affects everyday living. Providing both benefits and challenges to everyday activities, we believe a better understanding will help the average citizen to better use, or not use, this programming. </p>
</div>
<div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Why Focus on AI in Education?</strong> Education was not the first to be impacted by AI, but there has been a rise in the use and complaints against Ai since it has hit the education field. With both students and educators wishing to know more about, and wanting to interact with AI, we feel it is important to have a website that can answer questions as to what AI is and how it changes life in the classroom. </p>
