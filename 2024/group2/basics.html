                    <p>The concept of AI dates back to 400 BCE when philosophers would contemplate the term “automaton,” meaning “acting of one’s own will.” This includes reacting to a patron’s comments, coming up with solutions when prompted, and in some cases, problem solving. <a href="https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/history" target="_blank">Learn more at Tableau</a>.</p>

                    <p>As of 2015, OpenAI, a San Francisco startup, created a program known as ChatGPT. This program, which had the ability to have a conversation or write whatever it was prompted to write, would soon be seen as a plagiarism-like act that many educators would then blame all of AI for. However, the term “AI” is not only a lot larger than ChatGPT, but also includes other pros and cons in the education environment.</p>
