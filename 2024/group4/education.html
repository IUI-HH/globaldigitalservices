        <div class="introduction hidden"><h1>What does digitization mean for Education?</h1>
        <p>Technology has played an integral role in education for decades. In fact, it’s nearly impossible to imagine education and learning without some degree of technology and digitization. From computers in classrooms to online lesson plans and audiovisual aids to completely online degree programs, technology is irrevocably tied to 21st century education. Digitization in education has increased even more in recent years, especially in response to school closures and mandatory e-learning brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is evident in the significant market growth for digital e-learning tools. In 2019 this market was valued as USD 101 billion and is projected to reach USD 370 billion by 2026 (Rakha, 2023). This exponential increase shows that digital tools are only becoming more important and integral to education. </p>
        <img src="images/Education.jpeg" alt="A student using a tablet to learn in a classroom" class="introduction-img">
        <p>The use of digital tools and technologies in education opens up a new world of possibilities and challenges for students and educators. New educational technologies can provide much-needed flexibility and personalization in learning, with students able to learn in ways that best benefit their unique needs. In this new paradigm of education, teachers are beginning to move from the role of knowledge distributor to a learning supporter (Erikkson, 2019). They facilitate learning by constantly looking for new tools and technologies to enhance lessons and keep students engaged and interested (Carstens et al., 2021).  </p>
           

        <p>With this shift towards a heavily digitized education sector come challenges as well. While the flexibility of online learning and technological tools benefit many learners, the digital divide can keep others from reaping the benefits and, in fact, falling further behind than their peers. There are also concerns that overreliance on technology can lead to future issues for students in other areas such as handwriting and social skills. Other challenges include risks of cheating, security concerns, technological glitches and limited digital literacy, and information overload. It seems likely that education will continue to rely more and more on digital tools, so these challenges will have to be researched and mitigated.</p></div>
        <div class="pros hidden">
		<h1>Pros</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the biggest advantages of digitization in education is the possibility of more personalized learning. Digital tools enable educators to tailor materials, assignments, and learning methods to the needs of individual students which can help students succeed (Appleton, 2023). This ability to personalize can greatly benefit marginalized or disabled students, with tools such as speech recognition, screen-readers, video conferencing, and speech-to-text helping to ensure these students don’t fall further behind (Haleem et al., 2022). </li>
            <li>The gamification of learning via digital tools has been shown to improve students’ learning engagement. Techniques such as point systems, badges, and leaderboards on online games and learning tools can motivate even reluctant learners and tools such as virtual reality and learning games can help provide a more interactive and engaging experience for students (Rakha, 2023). As discovered in a meta-analysis of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, when these types of digital games were used to augment lessons, their competence and performance with the material was enhanced (Timotheou et al., 2023).</li>
            <li>Digital tools in education can help to increase collaboration and communication between students and with instructors. The ability to connect with anyone across the globe at any time has enabled new, unique opportunities for students to collaborate across cultures as well which can in turn increase global awareness (Raja & Nagasubramani, 2018).  </li>
            <li>Flexibility is a huge, obvious advantage of digitization in education. Modern technology allows students and instructors to access educational resources anytime, anywhere. Tools such as cloud storage, video recordings of lectures, and online notes make it easy for students to learn on their own time (Haleem et al., 2022). This level of flexibility and ease of access has led to the vast amount of online degree programs available nowadays, with all learning taking place through digital and online tools.</li>
            <li>Educational technology can help improve digital literacy and set students up for success in the modern world. Being able to effectively use technology is almost essential for modern life. The use of technology in education allows students to gain skills in digital literacy that will help them excel later in life, both in their future career and in simply navigating our increasingly digital world (Appleton, 2023). </li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cons hidden">
		<h1>Cons</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The digital divide is one of the biggest downsides to the ongoing digitization of education. Some students may miss out on the possible benefits of digital tools due to factors such as geographic location, socioeconomic background, culture, and lack of digital literacy (Erikkson, 2019). Research has shown that “schools in disadvantaged, rural, or deprived areas are likely to lack the digital capacity and infrastructure required to adapt to the use of digital technologies” (Timoteau et al., 2023). </li>
            <li>There has also been some research done on the effects of overreliance on technology in learning, such as solely using computers or cell phones to read, write, and communicate. The lack of face-to-face interaction and instruction can lead to maldeveloped social skills among students, especially those who solely participate in e-learning (Rakha, 2023). These virtual learning environments can also induce feelings of isolation and loneliness (Alhumaid, 2019). Additionally, writing skills have been shown to be negatively affected by typing and, especially, informal texting (Alhumaid, 2019).  </li>
            <li>Digitization in education can also be negatively affected by a lack of existing digital literacy and unfamiliarity with technology. Students without strong digital literacy, especially younger ones, may struggle to work through online courses or to use assigned digital tools effectively (Rakha, 2023). Likewise, teachers who aren’t familiar with technology will struggle to teach it and pass knowledge effectively to their students. This is clearly a limitation, as only 39% of European Union teachers reported that they are “well or very well prepared to use digital technologies for teaching” (Timotheou et al., 2023). </li>
            <li>Digital connectivity and the constant access to nearly endless information can be both a blessing and a curse for education. It’s significantly more challenging for students to discern the accuracy and appropriateness of information they find online for school. This can make it extremely difficult for teachers to monitor and makes them spend a significant amount of time managing what students are doing with technology (Carstens et al., 2021).</li>
            <li>Students almost constantly have internet-enabled devices on them, from cell phones and computers to less obvious pieces of technology like high-tech watches and graphic calculators. This makes it increasingly easy for them to cheat or become distracted from learning (Raja & Nagasubramani, 2018). The advent of easily accessible AI tools like Chat-GPT also enables students to cheat with digital tools, even having the software write whole papers for them.</li>
