        <div class="header"><h1>Communication</h1></div>
        <div class="introduction hidden"><h1>What does digitization mean for Communication?</h1>
        <p>Digitization has revolutionized communication in a myriad of ways. Instant messaging, email, and social media have made real-time communication across vast distances possible. Mobile technology ensures constant connectivity, while social networking platforms facilitate interactions and community building. The Covid-19 pandemic especially had a large impact in the amount of technology necessary for communication. The pandemic had a lasting effect on the number of people working remotely while still being able to access their teams globally; according to Lewis (2020) there are tens of millions of users daily on videoconferencing apps such as Zoom and Teams. There are more cell phone subscribers globally than there are people, as many people have multiple devices for work and personal use (West 2015, p. 2).</p>
        <img src="images/communication.png" class="introduction-img" alt="" width="400">
        <p>While digital communication offers unparalleled convenience and connectivity, allowing for instantaneous messaging and a global reach, it also presents challenges. The digital divide exacerbates inequalities in access to technology and opportunities. Furthermore, over-reliance on digital platforms may hinder face-to-face interactions, productivity, and the development of interpersonal skills. Despite these drawbacks, digital communication has become integral to modern life, necessitating careful management and consideration of its pros and cons to ensure responsible and effective use. </p></div>
        <div class="pros hidden">
		<h1>Pros</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency in using technology to communicate is one of its most significant advantages. Digital communication allows for instantaneous messaging and information exchange, facilitating fast and efficient interactions. Digitization can streamline communication processes through features like group chats, file sharing, and video conferencing. Messages can be sent and received anytime and from anywhere.</li>
            <li>Digital communication enables connections across the globe and fosters international collaborations and relationships. This has fundamentally changed both how business is conducted, as employees can collaborate with international colleagues and customers without the need to travel. It also enables the development of interpersonal relationships online, as people with shared interests can connect with like-minded people through online message boards and forums. It can bridge cultural divides and foster understanding among diverse groups. </li>
            <li>Public outreach through digital communication can increase the public’s engagement in society in ways such as emergency response and voter turnout. West (2015) states that political candidates can bypass traditional media and speak directly with the voter through a text message to their phone, almost like a personal conversation with the politician (p. 105). Additionally, the widespread use of mobile devices accesses individuals across various demographics and geographic locations.  </li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cons hidden">
		<h1>Cons</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Because digital platforms like social media have become integral to modern social interactions, a lack of access to digital technologies can lead to social isolation and missed opportunities for connection. This can exacerbate disparities between digitally connected and disconnected populations, potentially causing tensions in communities with varying levels of digital access (Kloza, 2023).</li>
            <li>Digital communication is susceptible to security breaches. Personal identifying information such as your name and location is often already collected simply by using social media such as Facebook, but private communication over digital technology such as Facebook Messenger could be at risk of accessed by more than “just you and the person you’re talking to” (Doffman, 2020). Once information is shared online, it can be challenging to retract or control, which can lead to long-term privacy implications and potential harm such as identity theft.</li>
            <li>Constant connectivity through smartphones and social media can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed or constantly "plugged in," which can negatively impact mental health. Moreover, the pressure to present an idealized version of oneself on social media platforms can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, leading to issues like depression and social anxiety.  </li>
        </ul>
