            <h1>What is digitization?</h1>
            <p>Digitization is the shift from analog formats to digital formats that allow computers to read and manage information. This leads in a new era of accessibility, efficiency, and connectivity. Digitization in our society can be seen in the simple shift from mailing a letter to sending an e-mail, or factory workers beginning to use computer-controlled equipment. On a global scale, digitization enables efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of information, which can facilitate tasks ranging from data management to communication and automation. Digitization revolutionizes industries by enhancing accessibility, scalability, and accuracy of information.</p>

            <h1>How does it apply to communities?</h1>
            <p>In today's rapidly evolving landscape, digitization stands as a cornerstone of the technological era. In a 2018 article, Royakkers et al. state that “Digitization penetrates every aspect of our lives: the technology nestles itself in us, between us, knows more and more about us, and is continually learning to behave more like us” (p. 127). As digital technology permeates everyday life, there are opportunities for advancement in sectors of life such as employment, healthcare, education, and communication. It significantly impacts communities in various ways, shaping how people interact, access information, and participate in economic and social activities. Increased connectivity to others, access to educational resources, and increased efficiency are among the most substantial impacts of digitization, but not every community benefits in the same way or has access to digital technologies. According to Repsol Global, there are over 3 billion people who do not have access to or do not know how to use digital technologies, which causes a “digital divide”. Digitization can also cause privacy concerns, job displacement, and negatively impact mental health. While the advantages of digitization can be revolutionary, they must be implemented with awareness of the disadvantages as well.  </p>
