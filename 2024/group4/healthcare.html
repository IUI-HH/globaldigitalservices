        <div class="introduction hidden"><h1>What does digitization mean for Healthcare?</h1>
        <p>Digitization affects every level of the healthcare system, affecting patients, providers, and organizations. There is a great promise for innovation to provide efficiency, accessibility, and new life-saving technologies and methods. But, as Kashaboina (2021) notes, the healthcare industry lags behind other industries in full-scale digitization. The COVID-19 pandemic certainly accelerated digitization but there is still a great deal of growth to be had.</p><p>Many different technologies and tools are included in what we consider to be healthcare digitization. From older technology such as electronic health records, electronic databases, telemedicine, and online patient portals (Kaihlanen et al., 2023) to wearable devices and biosensors, artificial intelligence, and robotics (Manteghinejad & Javanmard, 2021). All these modern innovations are pieces of the global shift towards digitized healthcare. The level of change required to implement all these different technologies and tools is immense, often requiring the entire work culture of organizations to change with digitization (Kaihlanen et al., 2023).</p>        <img src="images/healthcare.png" height="300" alt="A doctor typing on a laptop next to a stethoscope" class="introduction-img">
 <p>The benefits of digitization in healthcare are many. Like other industries, efficiency and accessibility is a huge benefit of moving towards online tools and modern technologies. Digitization can also help decrease costs for patients. Most importantly, the influx of new healthcare technologies such as wearable biosensors and AI-enhanced decision support systems can help save lives and improve patient care (Junaid et al., 2022). </p> <p>Challenges remain in the digital transformation of the healthcare industry. A well-known issue is the concerns for security and privacy with tons of private data existing in online systems. Connectivity, cost, and patient resistance to new technology can also impact the effectiveness of digitization. Additionally, the fact that healthcare digitization has happened rather slowly and very piecemeal has made it so there are many different systems, standards, regulations, and laws that do not always communicate properly causing major interoperability challenges (Kashaboina, 2021). The digital landscape of healthcare remains ongoing and is likely to change frequently over the coming years.   </p></div>

		<h1>Pros</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital technologies in healthcare help increase ease of access for many patients. The introduction of tools such as telemedicine, online doctor chats, and mobile healthcare allow people to access necessary services from anywhere at nearly anytime (Stoumpos et al., 2023). Patients who live in rural areas are among the most impacted by these services, allowing them to meet with healthcare professionals without long drives or costly services (APAC Med, 2022). Elderly patients or those with mobility issues also greatly benefit from these new digital technologies (APAC Med, 2022). </li>
            <li>Efficiency within healthcare systems is also positively affected by digitization. Online databases, AI-assisted automation, electronic patient records, and more all help to increase employee efficiency and productivity (Stoumpos et al., 2023). These tools can help free up healthcare professionals’ time to focus on treating patients. They can also help decrease operating costs for facilities.  </li>
            <li>Wearable devices and biosensors can have a positive effect on the healthcare industry. These gadgets provide real-time information and monitoring of human vital signs that can give key health data (Manteghinejad & Javanmard, 2021). Newer innovations of these monitoring devices include ones that can track electrolytes, blood glucose for diabetic patients, and more. The data gleaned from these devices can be used in myriad ways by healthcare professionals, such as disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care (Junaid et al., 2022).</li>
            <li>Digitization can help physicians make evidence-based decisions for patient health as well. Clinical decision support systems can aggregate huge amounts of patient data to help match treatments with results and predict who may be at risk. Artificial intelligence augments these systems and helps return results quickly (Junaid et al., 2022).</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cons hidden">
		<h1>Cons</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Security and privacy issues are some of the largest concerns for digitization in healthcare. Given the monitoring, collecting, exchange, and retrieval of private patient health information there is an increasing risk of this data being mishandled or hacked (Stoumpos et al., 2023). A lack of technology skills from both patients and healthcare professionals can increase these security issues, particularly if scams go unrecognized (APAC Med, 2022). Any malicious attacks such as ransomware on healthcare data can lead to a disruption of patient care (Kashaboina, 2021). </li>
            <li>While the common conception is that workload for professionals has decreased due to digitization, findings from a comprehensive survey of providers in Finland suggest that this may not always be the case. Professionals reported that the amount of work they had to do increased due to incorrect use of digital appointments and telehealth visits, lack of technological competency, and the number of required trainings to use new tools (Kaihlanen et al., 2023). </li>
            <li>Digitization isn’t a seamless process in any industry, but this is especially apparent for healthcare. Fragmented and complex legislation and regulations across many different regions makes the digital landscape for healthcare very confusing (APAC Med, 2022). This leads to issues of interoperability between systems as the lack of standards keeps them from easily communicating with each other (Kashaboina, 2021). </li>
            <li>A lack of digital literacy among both patients and providers can lead to major issues with healthcare digitization. Many digital healthcare tools and technologies may be unfamiliar to users and require a decent amount of time and effort to learn how to use them effectively. Without these skills, users will be unable to reap some of the benefits and impacts of digital healthcare (APAC Med, 2022). Related, some users are still distrustful of online and digital systems and are unwilling to learn the skills needed to navigate them (Kaihlanen et al., 2023).</li>
